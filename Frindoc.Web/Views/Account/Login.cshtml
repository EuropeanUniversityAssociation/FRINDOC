            <h2>Framework for the Internationalisation of Doctoral Education (FRINDOC)</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                This online tool is an outcome of the “Framework for Internationalisation of Doctoral Education”
                (FRINDOC) project. It is designed for universities interested in evaluating their internationalisation
                strategies for doctoral education.
            </p>
            <p>
                The FRINDOC project was coordinated by the European University Association (EUA) and managed
                by a consortium of six partners: the University of Hong Kong, Stellenbosch University, Imperial
                College London, the University of Bergen and the University of Camerino.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project resulted in two main outcomes. Firstly, a framework for universities to develop and
                implement their internationalisation strategies for doctoral education. It builds on the Salzburg
                Principles and Recommendations, which calls on universities to approach the internationalisation of
                doctoral education in a coherent and strategic manner. The framework can be found here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, this online tool functions as a comprehensive strategic tool for planning, promoting and
                supporting mobility in doctoral programmes enabling universities to attain a united picture of
                strategic goals, capacity and possibilities to implement the right structures for their particular
                profile.
            </p>
