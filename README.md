# FRINDOC
FRINDOC aims at providing a comprehensive overview of good practices and valuable experiences for universities. The project will develop a framework containing a statement of good practice on internationalisation and an online tool for universities to aid planning and implementation of internationalisation strategies for doctoral education. It will be a comprehensive strategic tool for planning, promoting and supporting mobility in doctoral programmes enabling universities to attain a united picture of strategic goals, capacity and possibilities to implement the right structures for their particular profile.

## Getting Started
Start by opening the solution in Visual Studio. The project uses Code-First Entity Framework which means that you can let Entity Framework generate the database structure for you. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Setup a database for this project in SQL Server Management Studio
2. Set the proper connectionstring for "DefaultConnection" in the Web.config of the Frindoc.Web project
3. Inside Visual Studio open the "Package Manager Console"
4. Run the command `Update-Database`

This will populate your database with the proper database structure.

Now you're ready to run the project.
